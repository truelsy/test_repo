<SYNC Start=62951>- Mike!<br>
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!
<SYNC Start=64685>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=64687>- What the hell are you doing?<br>
- It's called driving, Marcus.
<SYNC Start=67854>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=72894>Slow down!
<SYNC Start=74094>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=75097>What? Four minutes? Speed up.
<SYNC Start=76996>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=76998>Oh, so you want me to speed up<br>
and slow down at the same time?
<SYNC Start=80801>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=83372>Moving southbound on Collins.
<SYNC Start=84971>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=86676>- Fast approaching 22 Street.<br>
- <i>Copy that.</i>
<SYNC Start=89376>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=89378><i>Air support has a visual.</i>
<SYNC Start=91613>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=93548>Mike!
<SYNC Start=94815>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=101623>I'm about to throw up.
<SYNC Start=102989>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=102991>Oh, you bett... The hell not.
<SYNC Start=104825>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=104827>That is hand-stitched leather.<br>
You better drink it.
<SYNC Start=108096>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=112467><i>Blocking off 6th Street.</i>
<SYNC Start=114934>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=114936>That was your turn, Mike!
<SYNC Start=116302>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=116304>Damn it! Look, you are<br>
the navigator, okay?
<SYNC Start=118571>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=118573>That's why you're sitting<br>
in that seat.
<SYNC Start=120507>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=120509>Where are your glasses?<br>
You need to put your glasses on.
<SYNC Start=123376>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=123378>- I don't need glasses.<br>
- Marcus, you can't see shit.
<SYNC Start=126112>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=126114>Oh, sh... Mike. Mike. Mike.
<SYNC Start=127815>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=129017>- Relax. Relax!<br>
- Mike. Bus, bus, bus.
<SYNC Start=131050>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=145667>Sorry, rich white people.
<SYNC Start=148234>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=148236>We're not just black,<br>
we're cops too.
<SYNC Start=150637>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=150639>We'll pull ourselves<br>
over later.
<SYNC Start=152939>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=166756>Hoo-hoo!
<SYNC Start=167956>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=174697>Hey, even the Batmobile don't<br>
hold the road like this bitch.
<SYNC Start=177999>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=182504>- Whoo!<br>
- Get me the fuck out of this car.
<SYNC Start=187042>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=196819>- Hey!<br>
- Oh, shit.
<SYNC Start=199519>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=200890>Come on, man.
<SYNC Start=202088>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=202090>You can get that buffed out.
<SYNC Start=203456>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=203458>No. You can get that buffed out.
<SYNC Start=206259>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=206261>- Miami PD. Make a hole.<br>
- Coming through.
<SYNC Start=208294>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=208296>- Make a hole. Miami PD.<br>
- Miami PD.
<SYNC Start=209964>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=209966>Go! Go!
<SYNC Start=211765>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=211767>Sorry.
<SYNC Start=213032>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=216004>Daddy!
<SYNC Start=217136>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=218741>Joker.
<SYNC Start=220507>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=220509>You a pop-pop.
<SYNC Start=222475>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=230185>- Hi.<br>
- Oh. Oh.
<SYNC Start=234354>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=234356>- Oh, baby, look at him.<br>
- Yeah.
<SYNC Start=237023>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=237025>- No doubt. It's in the eyes.<br>
- Mm-hm.
<SYNC Start=239793>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=239795>And the ears.
<SYNC Start=241829>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=241831>And the name.
<SYNC Start=242897>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=242899>Marcus Miles Burnett.
<SYNC Start=245098>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=245100>- But that's my name.<br>
- His name too.
<SYNC Start=247467>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=247469>We decided to name him<br>
after you.
<SYNC Start=249335>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=249337>It was Reggie's idea.
<SYNC Start=251273>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=252674>Thought it would be<br>
a very respectful gesture, sir.
<SYNC Start=255341>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=255343>- I hope you approve.<br>
- That's cool.
<SYNC Start=257678>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=257680>But you still need<br>
to make a honest woman
<SYNC Start=259947>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=259949>out of my baby girl there.
<SYNC Start=261548>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=261550>Uncle Mike, ready<br>
to hold the baby?
<SYNC Start=263684>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=263686>Oh, mm-mm. No. Uncle Mike<br>
don't want to catch that.
<SYNC Start=267654>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=269324>Uh-uh, okay?<br>
That's that shit.
<SYNC Start=272125>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=272127>- No, Mike.<br>
- Stop.
<SYNC Start=273660>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=273662>Look at the baby.
<SYNC Start=274594>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=274596>Stop it right now.<br>
Seriously.
<SYNC Start=276262>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=276264>- Look at the baby.<br>
- Okay, you know what?
<SYNC Start=278431>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=278433>I'll be outside<br>
when you get your shit together.
<SYNC Start=282602>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=282604>Mike.
<SYNC Start=284070>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=284072>- The baby.<br>
- Oh, it's okay.
<SYNC Start=286541>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=301164>Let's go, ladies.
<SYNC Start=302454>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=303207>You're useless.
<SYNC Start=304463>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=304891>Move it!!
<SYNC Start=306123>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=309531>Aretas.
<SYNC Start=310700>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=312969>Aretas.
<SYNC Start=314702>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=380507>What the fuck?
<SYNC Start=381339>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=390751>Stop the ambulance!
<SYNC Start=392151>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=428017>Mama.
<SYNC Start=429384>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=431113>My son.
<SYNC Start=432140>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=445470>Don't be sad for his death.
<SYNC Start=447484>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=453386>The spirit of your father is free<br>
from the bars that confined him.
<SYNC Start=457276>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=460503>This is the last gift from Papa before he died.
<SYNC Start=464139>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=464920>You're a man now. You're finally<br>
ready for what needs to be done.
<SYNC Start=468999>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=469154>You must bring honor and respect<br>
back to our family.
<SYNC Start=472752>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=475172>Your father hid millions of dollars<br>
before he was locked up.
<SYNC Start=480057>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=480695>Here are the coordinates where you can find them.
<SYNC Start=482953>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=493543>We'll take back what's ours.
<SYNC Start=496403>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=501268>With this money we can finally get revenge.
<SYNC Start=504928>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=505770>The people who destroyed our family<br>
will know how it feels to be hunted.
<SYNC Start=512426>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=521599>He dies last.
<SYNC Start=524543>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=527283>Come here, Marcus. Come here.
<SYNC Start=529016>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=529018>We're here to celebrate and to<br>
raise a glass to one of our own.
<SYNC Start=532318>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=533521>And I sincerely hope<br>
that someday
<SYNC Start=535289>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=535291>your namesake follows<br>
in the footsteps
<SYNC Start=538292>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=538294>of his old-ass grandpa...
<SYNC Start=540060>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=541297>...to protect and serve<br>
our fair city.
<SYNC Start=544131>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=544133>To Marcus.
<SYNC Start=545199>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=545201>To Marcus!
<SYNC Start=547433>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=547435>May the name Marcus Burnett
<SYNC Start=549169>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=549171>strike fear into the hearts<br>
and minds of assholes
<SYNC Start=552505>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=552507>for years to come.
<SYNC Start=553907>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=556644>Thank y'all. Thank...<br>
Thank you all.
<SYNC Start=559146>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=559148>Mike and I, we're going on 25<br>
years of working these streets.
<SYNC Start=563951>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=563953>And I like to think<br>
we made a difference.
<SYNC Start=566320>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=566322>You all are the best.
<SYNC Start=568487>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=568489>And I thank you.<br>
It's been a real honor.
<SYNC Start=571390>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=572527>Marcus!
<SYNC Start=574393>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=574395><i>Marcus! Marcus! Marcus!</i>
<SYNC Start=578701>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=583605>Daddy buried<br>
that cash deep, huh?
<SYNC Start=585706>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=585708>If these are empty,<br>
you're still gonna owe.
<SYNC Start=588342>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=588344>- Whoa!<br>
- Mamma mia!
<SYNC Start=590679>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=595284>Buried treasure in the ocean.
<SYNC Start=596717>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=596719>I heard the stories,<br>
<i>pero coño...</i>
<SYNC Start=599585>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=599587>Should cover the cost<br>
of the materials we discussed.
<SYNC Start=603023>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=603025>And then some.
<SYNC Start=604425>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=606362>This is<br>
what you get to keep.
<SYNC Start=609595>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=609597>What'd you say?
<SYNC Start=610766>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=611934>We had a deal.
<SYNC Start=613333>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=613335>I'm renegotiating.
<SYNC Start=616003>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=616005>Whoops.
<SYNC Start=617072>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=629351>Whoops.
<SYNC Start=630516>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=631619>Come here.
<SYNC Start=633153>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=634957>Look at me.
<SYNC Start=635958>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=637192>I don't renegotiate.
<SYNC Start=639494>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=643132>My family's taking back<br>
management of this town.
<SYNC Start=646199>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=646201>We're gonna need some,<br>
uh, loyal employees.
<SYNC Start=649468>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=649470>Who wants a job?
<SYNC Start=650973>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=652440>So how's your dental?
<SYNC Start=654076>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=659014>Say that again.
<SYNC Start=660481>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=661814>Stay calm.
<SYNC Start=663433>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=668656>You give yourselves a raise.
<SYNC Start=670757>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=670759>You start with<br>
that pile right there.
<SYNC Start=672928>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=674063>- Okay?<br>
- Okay.
<SYNC Start=676065>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=682071>You work for me now.
<SYNC Start=683772>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=685640>Get your people to fall in line,
<SYNC Start=687140>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=687142>stay out of my fucking way,<br>
and I won't kill you.
<SYNC Start=690545>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=692848><i>Vamos, muchacho,</i><br>
get this money <i>¡Dale!</i>
<SYNC Start=695248>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=695250><i>Vamos.</i>
<SYNC Start=696316>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=698354><i>¡Vamos!</i>
<SYNC Start=699955>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=701357>Mama.
<SYNC Start=702789>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=702791><i>Armando.</i>
<SYNC Start=704557>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=704813>It's ours.
<SYNC Start=706109>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=706189>That was fast.
<SYNC Start=707337>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=707426>We got a new base of operations too.
<SYNC Start=709213>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=709443>You've spent so much time on the other<br>
side you sound like a gringo.
<SYNC Start=712975>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=717439>I'm done, Mike.
<SYNC Start=719439>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=719441>Oh, here we go again.
<SYNC Start=720907>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=720909>No, this time it's different.
<SYNC Start=722976>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=722978>When I looked into<br>
that little baby's eyes,
<SYNC Start=725278>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=725280>something changed.
<SYNC Start=726579>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=726581>I want to spend my days
<SYNC Start=727814>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=727816>watching that little boy grow.
<SYNC Start=730250>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=730252>Man, Theresa does not want<br>
your ass sitting at home,
<SYNC Start=733387>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=733389>getting fat and breaking shit.
<SYNC Start=735022>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=735024>You know, Mike, we got more time<br>
behind us than in front.
<SYNC Start=738692>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=738694>It's time to make<br>
some changes, for real.
<SYNC Start=741094>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=741096>You can miss me with that.<br>
I'm living my best life.
<SYNC Start=743997>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=743999>You're dyeing<br>
your goatee, Mike.
<SYNC Start=746433>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=746435>- What?<br>
- You're dyeing your goatee.
<SYNC Start=748634>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=748636>I am not dyeing my goatee.
<SYNC Start=750669>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=750671>That's Midnight Cocoa Bean.<br>
I recognize that.
<SYNC Start=752839>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=752841>- Go ahead with that shit.<br>
- That ain't Midnight Cocoa...?
<SYNC Start=755342>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=755344>- Go ahead somewhere.<br>
- Let me ask you something.
<SYNC Start=757511>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=757513>You want your legacy to be<br>
muscle shirts and a body count?
<SYNC Start=761782>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=761784>Don't you know family<br>
is all that matters?
<SYNC Start=764051>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=764053>Hey, granddaddy!
<SYNC Start=765584>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=765586>- Rita.<br>
- Oh, no. Pop-pop.
<SYNC Start=767454>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=767456>He's going with Pop-pop.
<SYNC Start=768755>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=768757>- Pop-pop?<br>
- Yeah.
<SYNC Start=770090>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=770092>Got pics, Pop-pop?
<SYNC Start=771124>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=771126>- Oh, you know I do, right?<br>
- Let's see.
<SYNC Start=773326>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=773328>There you go.
<SYNC Start=774696>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=776231>Oh, my God, the ears!
<SYNC Start=777964>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=777966>Yeah, my grandbaby.<br>
That's my grandbaby.
<SYNC Start=779966>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=781370>- I love him.<br>
- Yeah.
<SYNC Start=783103>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=783105>And congrats to you,<br>
lieutenant.
<SYNC Start=785172>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=785174>I hear Howard tapped you<br>
to head up AMMO.
<SYNC Start=787374>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=787376>Wow, congrats.
<SYNC Start=789309>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=789311>What's AMMO?
<SYNC Start=790544>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=790546>Advanced Miami Metro Operations.
<SYNC Start=792746>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=792748>A small team trained<br>
in new tactics
<SYNC Start=794580>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=794582>and investigative methods.
<SYNC Start=795916>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=795918>Gonna replace us old dogs.
<SYNC Start=798218>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=798220>- Or teach them some new tricks.<br>
- Heh.
<SYNC Start=800921>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=800923>For real, Marcus.<br>
So happy for you.
<SYNC Start=803523>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=803525>Thank you.
<SYNC Start=804991>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=810732>Hey, guys!
<SYNC Start=812532>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=812534>Hey! Everyone's here.
<SYNC Start=815402>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=815404>How are you?
<SYNC Start=816470>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=816472>Dumbass.
<SYNC Start=818038>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=818040>- What?<br>
- She is perfect for you.
<SYNC Start=820407>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=820409>Smart as hell.
<SYNC Start=822608>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=822610>Confident. Ambitious.
<SYNC Start=824478>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=824480>She just wasn't the one for me.
<SYNC Start=826213>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=826215>- All right?<br>
- What is for you?
<SYNC Start=827747>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=827749>Dying all alone<br>
and sad as shit?
<SYNC Start=829916>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=829918>You just jealous.
<SYNC Start=831184>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=831186>How long you been married?<br>
Twenty years?
<SYNC Start=833153>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=833155>- Twenty-six.<br>
- Tell the truth.
<SYNC Start=835288>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=835290>When's the last time<br>
you had sex?
<SYNC Start=837023>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=837025>- None of your damn business.<br>
- Exactly.
<SYNC Start=840093>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=840095>How many great women<br>
are you gonna let go? Heh.
<SYNC Start=842963>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=842965>I mean, you get<br>
a lot of loving,
<SYNC Start=844798>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=844800>but have you ever<br>
really been in love?
<SYNC Start=846933>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=846935>Of course. I mean, yeah,<br>
I was... I was in love.
<SYNC Start=851304>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=851306>One time.
<SYNC Start=852772>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=852774>A long, long time ago.
<SYNC Start=854841>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=854843>You never told me.
<SYNC Start=856143>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=856145>Nigga, I don't tell you<br>
all my business.
<SYNC Start=858512>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=858514>Look, all you need to know
<SYNC Start=860046>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=860048>is that I'll be running down<br>
criminals till I'm 100.
<SYNC Start=863216>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=863218>You the last brother<br>
that needs to be talking
<SYNC Start=865385>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=865387>about running down anyone<br>
after the hospital.
<SYNC Start=867754>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=867756>The hospital?<br>
What you talking about?
<SYNC Start=869655>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=869657>What happened at the hospital?
<SYNC Start=871091>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=871093>Running to see baby Marcus.
<SYNC Start=872792>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=872794>I dusted your ass.
<SYNC Start=874394>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=874396>You spent that run staring<br>
at my one good ass-cheek, Mike.
<SYNC Start=878098>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=878100>You're saying that<br>
you actually outran me?
<SYNC Start=881101>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=881103>- You beat me in a footrace?<br>
- It's been said.
<SYNC Start=883837>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=883839>Oh, hell, no.
<SYNC Start=885071>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=885073>Nothing sadder than old men
<SYNC Start=886873>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=888041>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=888043>Whoa, hey, no stretching.
<SYNC Start=889676>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=889678>Stretching is cheating.
<SYNC Start=891344>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=891346>- Hey, who you got, Cap?<br>
- I got 50 on a torn ACL.
<SYNC Start=895148>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=895951>I ain't running for free.
<SYNC Start=897250>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=897252>- What's the bet?<br>
- I win, we lay it down.
<SYNC Start=899986>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=899988>We turn in our papers<br>
and we retire.
<SYNC Start=902956>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=911531>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=911533>ain't really boys anymore.
<SYNC Start=912999>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=913001>Hey, Cap, just<br>

<SYNC Start=917737>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=919873>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=975929>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=975931>Get an ambulance!
<SYNC Start=977364>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=977366>- Come on, Mike. Come on.<br>
- Hey, hey, hey.
<SYNC Start=979666>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=979668>Phone... I got him on the phone.
<SYNC Start=981901>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=984539>You gonna be all right.<br>
You gonna make it through this.
<SYNC Start=987507>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=987509>Come on, man. Stay with us, man.
<SYNC Start=989109>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=1038927>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1039995>I was ashamed
<SYNC Start=1042730>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=1142758>I'm the one up here.

<SYNC Start=1336692>All right. Let's do this.
<SYNC Start=1338391>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1354110>First off, Reggie,
<SYNC Start=1356844>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1356846>I am shocked that you<br>
are even still here.
<SYNC Start=1360346>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1361583>I remember your first date<br>
with Megan,
<SYNC Start=1363751>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1363753>and trust me, me and Marcus did<br>
everything we could possibly do
<SYNC Start=1367988>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1367990>to make sure<br>
you never came back.
<SYNC Start=1370523>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1370525>But I'm telling you,<br>
love is hard.
<SYNC Start=1374293>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1374295>And your relationship<br>
will be tested.

<SYNC Start=1377198>And your father and I have<br>
weathered storm after storm.
<SYNC Start=1382803>&nbsp;

to bring us back together.

<SYNC Start=1391814>And, Reggie, Megan, I would<br>
like to share it with you.

the Vargas case.
<SYNC Start=1480266>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1480268>No. The last thing I need

<SYNC Start=1506929>Uh, yeah.
<SYNC Start=1508695>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1508697>- I told you I was retiring.<br>

<SYNC Start=1532755>What did he take from you, Mike?
<SYNC Start=1535022>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1535024>You're still here.
<SYNC Start=1536355>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1536357>All he took from you<br>
was the legend,

<SYNC Start=1547600>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1547602>Heh, I'm telling you, Mike.

<SYNC Start=1602691>You just gonna quit?
<SYNC Start=1604392>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1606661>How dare you, man?
<SYNC Start=1609462>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1609464>I sat by your bedside.
<SYNC Start=1611967>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1613501>I wiped the drool<br>
off your chin, Mike.
<SYNC Start=1617371>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1617373>Don't disrespect me like that<br>
because you don't know.
<SYNC Start=1620073>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1620075>All right, all right.<br>
All right, man.
<SYNC Start=1623076>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1624612>Look, Marcus,
<SYNC Start=1627681>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1627683>I'm asking you.
<SYNC Start=1629484>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1630485>I'm begging you, man.
<SYNC Start=1633655>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1635324>I need this.
<SYNC Start=1636825>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1638260>Bad boys...
<SYNC Start=1639695>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1641030>one last time.
<SYNC Start=1642597>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1651307>No, Mike.
<SYNC Start=1652841>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1655010>No.
<SYNC Start=1655945>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1685536>Everything for you, Papa.
<SYNC Start=1687510>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1696484>Mama.
<SYNC Start=1697463>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1697465>He didn't die.
<SYNC Start=1698290>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1699126>Isn't that what you wanted?
<SYNC Start=1701011>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1701420>Santa Muerte wouldn't let him die<br>
before he suffered as we have.
<SYNC Start=1705211>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1705410>Don't kill him until I tell you.
<SYNC Start=1707227>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1707628>He will suffer.

<SYNC Start=2064886>- What'd I tell you?<br>
- I know.
<SYNC Start=2066486>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2066488>I'm not supposed<br>
to investigate my own case.
<SYNC Start=2069089>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2069091>But this fool posted a video<br>
of him trying to kill me.
<SYNC Start=2072359>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2072361>I saw it.
<SYNC Start=2073828>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2073830>I can go after him<br>
vigilante style,
<SYNC Start=2075628>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2075630>or you can bring me in.
<SYNC Start=2076831>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2076833>Or I could shoot you myself.
<SYNC Start=2078934>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2080402>Fuck me!
<SYNC Start=2082135>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2082137>Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck!
<SYNC Start=2085140>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2090780>- If...<br>
- Mm-hm.
<SYNC Start=2092345>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2092347>...I bring you in, to consult,
<SYNC Start=2095215>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2095217>and you go cowboy on me,
<SYNC Start=2097217>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2097219>I need you to comprehend<br>
the level-five shitstorm
<SYNC Start=2100220>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2100222>I will be drowning in.
<SYNC Start=2101789>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2101791>No gold-plated watch.
<SYNC Start=2103824>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2103826>No cop retirement village.
<SYNC Start=2105425>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2105427>I'm sticking myself out<br>
on a skinny limb!
<SYNC Start=2108228>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2108230>Scratch that.<br>
A twig in an ice storm!
<SYNC Start=2111866>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2111868>Me, on the edge, "tithering."
<SYNC Start=2114567>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2114569>You mean, teetering?
<SYNC Start=2116035>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2116037>That's what I said!
<SYNC Start=2117705>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2117707>And picture me very fat!
<SYNC Start=2120106>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2120108>Uh, think I got the image, Cap.
<SYNC Start=2122509>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2122511>- What is he doing here?<br>
- He's gonna be helping out.
<SYNC Start=2125378>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2125380>- I don't want him.<br>
- I'm not working with her.
<SYNC Start=2127480>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2127482>He's not. You're not.<br>
He's consulting. It's your show.
<SYNC Start=2130785>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2130787>- Captain, come on.<br>
- Wait.
<SYNC Start=2132018>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2132020>I know you guys<br>
got history together,
<SYNC Start=2134020>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2134022>- so let's not make it personal.<br>
- Personal?
<SYNC Start=2136456>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2136458>I'm the only one<br>
being professional.
<SYNC Start=2138258>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2138260>This is not détente. I'm<br>
informing you of my decision.
<SYNC Start=2140660>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2140662>This is a bad idea.
<SYNC Start=2142128>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2142130>He's gonna investigate<br>
this case, no matter what!
<SYNC Start=2145532>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2147703>So this way, we keep him on<br>
a short leash, we control him.
<SYNC Start=2151772>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2151774>Uh, I'm standing<br>
right here, Cap.
<SYNC Start=2154941>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2156011>Mike will consult.
<SYNC Start=2158111>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2158113>He'll observe.
<SYNC Start=2159880>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2159882>That's it.
<SYNC Start=2161047>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2161049>Now, what do you got?
<SYNC Start=2162449>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2162451>Picked up chatter.<br>
The dealer we think customed
<SYNC Start=2164718>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2164720>those rounds,<br>
he's making another sale.
<SYNC Start=2166887>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2166889>- Booker Grassie.<br>
- Uh-huh.
<SYNC Start=2168321>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2168323>You share any other<br>
confidential information?
<SYNC Start=2170557>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2170559>What? Not me.<br>
He's the one that told me.
<SYNC Start=2173426>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2173428>Guess my old tricks<br>
still work a little bit.
<SYNC Start=2176296>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2176298>You're a distraction.
<SYNC Start=2179065>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2179067>You see that?<br>
That's what I like, teamwork.
<SYNC Start=2182502>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2182504>Already<br>
a beautiful relationship.
<SYNC Start=2186039>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=2202390>- Thrilled to see you've had...<br>
- Sweet.
<SYNC Start=2203891>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2203893>I am much better now. Thank you.
<SYNC Start=2205860>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2205862>I am so sorry about that.

You can just do Mike.
<SYNC Start=2214300>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2214302>- For sure, Mike.<br>
- Got it, Mike.
<SYNC Start=2215870>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2215872>Yeah, sure thing, Michael.
<SYNC Start=2217203>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2217205>- Ah, so you're that guy.<br>
- Hey, there's always one.
<SYNC Start=2220406>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2220408>- Yeah. Right up till there's not.<br>
- What's that supposed to mean?
<SYNC Start=2223476>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2223478>It's Mike Lowrey, okay?<br>
Be cool. For once.
<SYNC Start=2225880>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2225882>Let's load up!
<SYNC Start=2227380>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2229819>Ooh.
<SYNC Start=2231384>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2231386>Think I might be able to hang<br>
out with you guys after all.
<SYNC Start=2234521>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2234523>Nah, nah, that ain't the one.<br>
We're taking The Crawdaddy.
<SYNC Start=2238558>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2238560>Wait until you see the inside.
<SYNC Start=2240995>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2240997>- You need any help, Gramps?<br>
- Go ahead somewhere, boy.
<SYNC Start=2243630>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2243632>Look at you trying to be<br>
all cool and shit.
<SYNC Start=2246401>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2251072>Okay, everybody<br>
is way too serious.
<SYNC Start=2253908>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2253910>Raids are supposed to be fun.
<SYNC Start=2255308>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2255310>They're like field trips<br>
with guns.
<SYNC Start=2258244>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2258246>This is not a raid.<br>
It's surveillance.
<SYNC Start=2262016>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2262018>Surveillance? Right.
<SYNC Start=2263583>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2263585>Meaning we're just gonna<br>
watch the crime.
<SYNC Start=2266152>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2266154>We'll record him in the deal
<SYNC Start=2267520>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2267522>and bring him in<br>
facing serious time.
<SYNC Start=2269389>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2269391>Then we'll get him to talk<br>
and he's gonna tell us
<SYNC Start=2271926>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2271928>everything that we need to know.
<SYNC Start=2273626>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2273628>Or since he's gonna be there<br>
and we're gonna be there,
<SYNC Start=2277932>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2277934>I mean, we could just grab him.
<SYNC Start=2280066>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2280068>Well, thank you for your input.
<SYNC Start=2282168>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2282170>Okay.
<SYNC Start=2283804>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2283806>Listen up.
<SYNC Start=2285005>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2285007>Booker Grassie is the guy
<SYNC Start=2286372>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2286374>that sold the bullets<br>
we took out of Michael.
<SYNC Start=2289409>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2289411>Hey, look, um, you think<br>
you could stop
<SYNC Start=2292645>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2292647>calling me Michael<br>
in front of everybody?
<SYNC Start=2294882>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2294884>It's your name.
<SYNC Start=2296384>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2297687>Okay.
<SYNC Start=2298821>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2300890><i>Relax and clear your mind.</i>
<SYNC Start=2303623>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2304459><i>Use God's inspiration</i>
<SYNC Start=2305826>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2305828><i>to bring people<br>
peace and tranquility</i>
<SYNC Start=2307861>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2307863><i>by penetrating their souls<br>
with your heart.</i>
<SYNC Start=2311600>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2319976>We're here.
<SYNC Start=2322241>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2322243>Excuse me, Mr. Lowrey.
<SYNC Start=2323978>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2323980>- Just need to get past, please.<br>
- Sure thing, buddy.
<SYNC Start=2327681>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2327683>Uh, you're the tech, huh? Jeez.
<SYNC Start=2332287>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2333521>They just leave you<br>
in the van?
<SYNC Start=2335956>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2335958>Yeah, I'm more, uh...<br>
More comfortable in here.
<SYNC Start=2338926>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2338928>Got it.
<SYNC Start=2340828>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2340830>Sending in Big Barry.
<SYNC Start=2342161>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2342163>You're not Big Barry?
<SYNC Start=2343563>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2343565>He's our, uh,<br>
surveillance drone.
<SYNC Start=2346399>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2346401>Ah, so you send the drone in.
<SYNC Start=2349268>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2350873>Let's fly.
<SYNC Start=2352207>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2359514>I guess Barry gets<br>
to have all the fun.
<SYNC Start=2362417>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2364086>There. Black pickup truck.
<SYNC Start=2365686>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2365688>- That's our H-77 Boyz.<br>
- Who are they?
<SYNC Start=2367988>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2367990>These guys are definitely<br>
from out of town. Trying to step up.
<SYNC Start=2372092>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2372094>I need wide angle, whole deal.
<SYNC Start=2374730>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2382905>Zoom in.
<SYNC Start=2383906>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2389145>Booker's hooking them up<br>
with a crate of 5.7-by-28s.
<SYNC Start=2392715>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2394282>- That's Booker Grassie.<br>
- There's our deal.
<SYNC Start=2396418>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2397519>Audio.
<SYNC Start=2398317>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2398319><i>Here it is.</i>
<SYNC Start=2399753>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2399755>These will put a hole<br>
through anyone
<SYNC Start=2401755>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2401757>and anything<br>
you point your gun at.
<SYNC Start=2404624>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2404626>- <i>I guarantee my product.</i><br>
- He's right there, Rita.
<SYNC Start=2407193>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2407195>- We can grab him.<br>
- No.
<SYNC Start=2408929>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2408931>I'm not risking<br>
the collateral damage.
<SYNC Start=2411664>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2411666>- Let's move.<br>
- Let's wait.
<SYNC Start=2414034>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2414036>- You're the boss.<br>
- Yeah, I know.
<SYNC Start=2415869>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2415871>- That's what I just said.<br>
- I just confirmed it.
<SYNC Start=2418237>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2418239>- Okay.<br>
- You two used to date, right?
<SYNC Start=2421141>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2421143>- Sort of.<br>
- Not really.
<SYNC Start=2422442>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2422444><i>Need to see the cash.</i>
<SYNC Start=2424512>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2425715>- <i>See the cash.</i><br>
- Wait.
<SYNC Start=2427948>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2427950>Back. Go back.<br>
Right there. That guy.
<SYNC Start=2430483>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2430485>- What?<br>
- <i>I need to see it.</i>
<SYNC Start=2432019>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2432021>The bag is empty.
<SYNC Start=2433687>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2433689>There's no money in the bag.<br>
It's a rip.
<SYNC Start=2436056>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2436058><i>I need to see yours.</i>
<SYNC Start=2437157>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2437159>They're gonna kill...<br>
It's a rip.
<SYNC Start=2438491>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2438493>- Michael.<br>
- We need Booker alive!
<SYNC Start=2439860>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2439862>Michael, get back here!
<SYNC Start=2441461>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2441463>Shit. Kelly, go. Go!
<SYNC Start=2444330>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2452407>Get me body cams.
<SYNC Start=2454375>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2466722><i>Michael, do not engage</i>
<SYNC Start=2468756>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2468758><i>until we have the rest<br>
of the team in position.</i>
<SYNC Start=2471359>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2478266>Can we count the cash, or what?
<SYNC Start=2480299>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2480301>This is a nice song.<br>
Put it louder.
<SYNC Start=2483638>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2487275>Now!
<SYNC Start=2488878>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2555144>Put it down! Put it down!
<SYNC Start=2557543>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2557545>Can you hear me?
<SYNC Start=2559012>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2559014>I'm gonna need you<br>
to lay me down some cover.
<SYNC Start=2561380>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2561382>We're coming to you.
<SYNC Start=2563050>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2563052>All right. You wanna live,<br>
you stay with me.
<SYNC Start=2566753>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2566755>Fuck with me<br>
and I'm gonna kill you.
<SYNC Start=2569790>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2569792>Coming at you on three.
<SYNC Start=2572159>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2572161>Bring the truck! Grab the merch!
<SYNC Start=2574493>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2574495>One, two, three.
<SYNC Start=2579565>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2612768>Shit.
<SYNC Start=2613869>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2616205>Shit.
<SYNC Start=2618105>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2618107>Shit. Hey. Hey. Booker.
<SYNC Start=2620040>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2620042>Booker, look at me.<br>
Hey. Hey. Don't die.
<SYNC Start=2623143>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2623145>P90 Herstals. P90 Herstals,<br>
who's the buyer?
<SYNC Start=2627147>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2627149>Oh, shit.
<SYNC Start=2628650>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2634455>- Hey, hey. Booker. Booker.<br>
- Michael?
<SYNC Start=2637190>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2637192>Hey, get an ambulance in here<br>
now. Get the paramedics.
<SYNC Start=2639927>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2639929>- Booker. Booker.<br>
- Uh, Michael.
<SYNC Start=2641962>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2641964>- Just bring them in.<br>
- Calm down.
<SYNC Start=2644298>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2644300>Hey, just do what I ask you<br>
for once, please!
<SYNC Start=2646934>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2646936>He's dead!
<SYNC Start=2648335>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2653008>- Is that Diego or his twin?<br>
- Shh!
<SYNC Start=2655375>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2655377>Yeah, yeah, his twin.
<SYNC Start=2656777>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2656779>Carmelita, no, no, no.
<SYNC Start=2659279>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2666121>- Who this?<br>
- <i>It's Carver Remy.</i>
<SYNC Start=2668654>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2668656>Look here, I'm busy, all right?
<SYNC Start=2670656>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2670658>Don't waste my time, Carver.<br>
Leave me alone.
<SYNC Start=2672926>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2672928><i>Come on, man. It's important.</i>
<SYNC Start=2675162>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2675164>Keep an eye on my baby.
<SYNC Start=2676562>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2676564>- <i>Marcus.</i><br>
- I'm retired.
<SYNC Start=2679199>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2679201>Only rats I talk to
<SYNC Start=2680466>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2680468>are in my basement.
<SYNC Start=2681835>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2681837>- Carmelita shot the wrong twin!<br>
- Oh, shit.
<SYNC Start=2685671>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2685673>The guy who shot Mike,<br>
he's trying to kill me.
<SYNC Start=2687874>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2687876>- What?<br>
- <i>I'm serious.</i>
<SYNC Start=2689409>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2689411><i>A guy on a black bike's<br>
been tracking me.</i>
<SYNC Start=2691610>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2691612><i>The one on the news. It's him.</i>
<SYNC Start=2693180>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2693182>- Bullshit.<br>
- <i>Marcus, would I lie to you?</i>
<SYNC Start=2695949>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2695951>Yes. That's why we stopped<br>
using your ass as a CI.
<SYNC Start=2699119>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2699121>- I'm telling you, it's him.<br>
- What do you want?
<SYNC Start=2701554>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2701556><i>Protective custody. To not die.</i>
<SYNC Start=2703790>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2703792><i>Please, man.<br>
Use me as bait, whatever.</i>
<SYNC Start=2706525>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2706527>You want this guy?<br>
He's coming for me.
<SYNC Start=2709062>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2709064>- You talk to Mike?<br>
- <i>I called you.</i>
<SYNC Start=2711398>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2711400><i>Nineteenth and Miami.<br>
Third floor. I'll be waiting.</i>
<SYNC Start=2714870>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2724079>What did I say? No, no.<br>
What did I say?
<SYNC Start=2728081>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2728083>I said consult.<br>
I said observe. I...
<SYNC Start=2731018>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2731020>Look at this... This mess.<br>
It's carnage!
<SYNC Start=2733586>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2733588>I didn't do all this shit.<br>
They did this to each other.
<SYNC Start=2736589>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2736591>Wait, wait, wait.<br>
You didn't shoot anybody?
<SYNC Start=2738792>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2738794>- You know I shot some people.<br>
- Yeah.
<SYNC Start=2741061>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2741063>- Look, they had already started.<br>
- What...?
<SYNC Start=2743263>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2743265>Ah, Jesus. Mike, you promised.
<SYNC Start=2745098>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2745100>- No, no, I didn't promise.<br>
- You promised.
<SYNC Start=2747300>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2747302>- I said I could picture you...<br>
- Yeah.
<SYNC Start=2749069>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2749071>...on a limb, fat as hell,<br>
with sharks and some shit.
<SYNC Start=2751637>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2751639>Right. That's a promise.
<SYNC Start=2752806>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2752808>We were here to watch.
<SYNC Start=2753940>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2753942>What? Yeah, and I saw.
<SYNC Start=2755409>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2755411>All right, Cap, look.
<SYNC Start=2756777>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2756779>The bag is empty,<br>
all right? No cash.
<SYNC Start=2759880>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2759882>The guy reached up<br>
and scratched his nose.
<SYNC Start=2761982>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2761984>I saw it had no weight to it.
<SYNC Start=2763817>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2763819>- That's very impressive, sir.<br>
- Yeah. See, I like that one.
<SYNC Start=2766853>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2766855>If I hadn't come in, Grassie<br>
was a dead man for sure.
<SYNC Start=2769356>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2769358>That's a relief, because<br>
your guy's in a body bag
<SYNC Start=2771892>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2771894>- and he sure looks dead.<br>
- Cap. Ah...
<SYNC Start=2774394>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2774396>Good job, Mikey.
<SYNC Start=2775529>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2775531>Hey, look. Young boy, seriously.
<SYNC Start=2777898>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2777900>Let me tell you something.
<SYNC Start=2779232>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2779234>Stay in a child's place,<br>
all right?
<SYNC Start=2781201>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2781203>Spare me the street knowledge,<br>
grandpa. Nobody asked.
<SYNC Start=2783937>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2783939>Just because<br>
I fucked your mother
<SYNC Start=2785638>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2785640>- don't make me your grandpa?<br>
- Oh, oh, oh.
<SYNC Start=2787640>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2787642>- Fucked my mother?<br>
- That's enough.
<SYNC Start=2789109>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2789111>- Stop.<br>
- You got me fucked up.
<SYNC Start=2790844>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2790846>- Old ass.<br>
- Stand down! Let's go.
<SYNC Start=2792446>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2792448>- You better go on.<br>
- Let's go.
<SYNC Start=2793747>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2793749>I will knock your ass<br>
clean the fuck out.
<SYNC Start=2795782>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2795784>- Knock me out. Hit me.<br>
- What am I,
<SYNC Start=2797250>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2797252>a nursery school teacher?<br>
Come on, let's go!
<SYNC Start=2799618>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2799620>Shit. I got time today.
<SYNC Start=2801620>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2801622>Cool down. Keep walking.
<SYNC Start=2804623>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2804625>- Excuse me, sir.<br>
- Go ahead, man.
<SYNC Start=2807861>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2807863>- Do you guys want a...?<br>
- No, go.
<SYNC Start=2809396>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2809398>Just go ahead somewhere.
<SYNC Start=2810866>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2812568>What?
<SYNC Start=2813735>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2825314>What, quitter?
<SYNC Start=2826647>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2829952>This is some sad shit.
<SYNC Start=2832087>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2833288>Where the hell is your ride?
<SYNC Start=2834721>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2834723>Girls took it to the spa.
<SYNC Start=2836692>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2845134>You all right?
<SYNC Start=2846566>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2846568>I'm fine. You all right?
<SYNC Start=2848802>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2848804>Never felt better.
<SYNC Start=2850772>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2852474>I mean, you could,
<SYNC Start=2854241>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2854243>if you wanted to,
<SYNC Start=2856409>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2856411>just do the speed limit.
<SYNC Start=2859012>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2859014>You let a Prius pass us.
<SYNC Start=2860949>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2863318>And what is that? What, you got<br>
your balls tucked up in there?
<SYNC Start=2866486>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2866488>Hey. You know what?<br>
Neither one of my balls
<SYNC Start=2869289>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2869291>wanna be here<br>
with your stupid ass.
<SYNC Start=2871793>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2877933>You brought Little Marcus<br>
on a murder investigation?
<SYNC Start=2881067>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2881069>We're dropping him at the spa.
<SYNC Start=2883336>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2883338>Dropping him off at the spa?
<SYNC Start=2885205>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2885207>Carver is scared.<br>
He is not gonna wait, man.
<SYNC Start=2888742>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2888744>It's on the way, Mike.
<SYNC Start=2890043>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2890045>And what's the person<br>
that shot me
<SYNC Start=2891945>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2891947>want with a snitch<br>
like Carver Remy anyway?
<SYNC Start=2894347>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2894349>I'm taking you<br>
to find out, motherfucker.
<SYNC Start=2897286>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2898754>Sorry about that, Little Marcus.
<SYNC Start=2900754>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2900756>Pop-pop shouldn't be swearing<br>
like that.
<SYNC Start=2902656>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2902658>Only when you're dealing<br>
with people like Mike Lowrey,
<SYNC Start=2905892>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2905894>you got no fucking choice.
<SYNC Start=2908562>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2908564>Sorry. There I go again.
<SYNC Start=2910098>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2919274>- Take the baby in.<br>
- Oh, I ain't going in there.
<SYNC Start=2921741>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2921743>Then you ain't gonna find out<br>
who tried to kill you.
<SYNC Start=2924444>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2924446>See, if I go in there,<br>
I know who's gonna kill me.
<SYNC Start=2927113>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2927115>- Theresa Burnett.<br>
- Stop fucking around.
<SYNC Start=2929182>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2929184>Take your baby. Go ahead.
<SYNC Start=2930650>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2930652>Mike, Carver's scared.
<SYNC Start=2933119>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2933121>He ain't gonna wait all day.
<SYNC Start=2934921>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2934923>All right.
<SYNC Start=2936158>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2937192>All right.
<SYNC Start=2938992>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2950973>Uh-uh. No. Mike! Mike!
<SYNC Start=2955242>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2955244>Tell Marcus I'm gonna kill him!
<SYNC Start=2957544>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2957546>Go, go!
<SYNC Start=2958912>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2958914>- Go, go, go!<br>
- What'd she do? What'd you do?
<SYNC Start=2961114>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2961116>- Is she coming? Oh, shit!<br>
- Go, go, go!
<SYNC Start=2963516>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2964721>Mike, you known Theresa<br>
a long time.
<SYNC Start=2966820>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2966822>How pissed would you say<br>
she was?
<SYNC Start=2968488>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2968490>- What you mean? Like, one to 10?<br>
- Yeah, 10 being...
<SYNC Start=2971091>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2971093>Like when I broke up<br>
with your sister?
<SYNC Start=2972826>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2972828>No. That was me at a 10.
<SYNC Start=2974729>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2974731>- Why would you bring that up?<br>
- All right. I'm just trying to...
<SYNC Start=2978031>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2978033>No, a Theresa 10 would be...
<SYNC Start=2979566>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2979568>Me that time you spilled<br>
Frappuccino in my Ferrari.
<SYNC Start=2982369>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2982371>Yeah, yeah, that's it.<br>
That's it.
<SYNC Start=2984739>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2984741>Uh, she's probably<br>
like a nine, then.
<SYNC Start=2986906>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2986908>- A nine? Oh, sh...<br>
- Yeah, man.
<SYNC Start=2990477>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2990479>Oh, shit.
<SYNC Start=2992112>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2992114>Better make it a 10.
<SYNC Start=2994247>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2994249>Forgot to give her<br>
the baby wipes.
<SYNC Start=2995982>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=2995984>Oh, tragedy.
<SYNC Start=2997384>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3001490>Are you stopping?
<SYNC Start=3003957>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3003959>Dude, that was a yellow light.
<SYNC Start=3006493>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3006495>We are in a hurry. Come on...
<SYNC Start=3009562>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3011633>Oh, what? You embarrassed<br>
to be seen like this?
<SYNC Start=3014601>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3016571>We got Mike Lowrey here!
<SYNC Start=3018438>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3019709>Mike Lowrey in a Nissan Quest!
<SYNC Start=3022844>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3024446>Nobody gives a shit, Mike.
<SYNC Start=3026179>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3026181>He's... He's my Uber driver!
<SYNC Start=3028984>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3030519>A big part of fighting crime
<SYNC Start=3032285>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3032287>is being ahead of the criminals.
<SYNC Start=3034387>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3034389>You don't have<br>
to stop for pigeons.
<SYNC Start=3036323>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3036325>You just drive up to them.<br>
They'll fly away.
<SYNC Start=3039227>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3044199>That better be a safe...
<SYNC Start=3047802>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3047804>or a piano.
<SYNC Start=3049338>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3050339>Oh!
<SYNC Start=3051739>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3051741>- This is my wife's car!<br>
- And that's fucking Carver Remy!
<SYNC Start=3055408>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3055410>You don't know that's Carver<br>
Remy. That could be anybody.
<SYNC Start=3058278>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3058280>- Cover the front door!<br>
- I'm retired!
<SYNC Start=3061348>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3061350>I'm a civilian!
<SYNC Start=3062551>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3063885>Oh...
<SYNC Start=3065352>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3068890>This is a sign.
<SYNC Start=3070725>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3070727>It's a sign from God.
<SYNC Start=3072459>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3073862>Oh!
<SYNC Start=3074894>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3074896>Oh, shoot.
<SYNC Start=3076896>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3076898>She knows.
<SYNC Start=3078699>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3078701>She always knows.
<SYNC Start=3080467>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3085340>I need 315<br>
at the Broadmoor Hotel.
<SYNC Start=3088610>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3093281>Fuck!
<SYNC Start=3094349>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3102557>God, I know I asked you<br>
to help Mike out before...
<SYNC Start=3105394>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3107028>but he's really<br>
getting his ass whupped.
<SYNC Start=3109498>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3111600>Lord, give me a sign.
<SYNC Start=3113433>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3126081>What the hell are you doing?<br>
Mike!
<SYNC Start=3129084>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3141963>Shit!
<SYNC Start=3143596>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3181871>You okay?
<SYNC Start=3183338>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3184707>I'm better than you gonna be<br>
when Theresa see this car.
<SYNC Start=3187474>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3198169>I had him.
<SYNC Start=3199490>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3200120>I had him right there.
<SYNC Start=3201594>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3202729>I don't understand, Mama.
<SYNC Start=3204326><i>Armando...</i>
<SYNC Start=3205924>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3205926>A bullet is mercy for this son of a bitch<br>
who took your father from me.
<SYNC Start=3211730>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3212074>He needs to suffer.
<SYNC Start=3213925>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3214444>Then he dies.
<SYNC Start=3216929>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3217814>You understand?
<SYNC Start=3218751>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3219102>Yes.
<SYNC Start=3220076>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3245968>Pass it! Pass it! Thattagirl!
<SYNC Start=3249469>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3252040>Thattagirl, Callie!
<SYNC Start=3253707>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3253709>Make them wanna play soccer!
<SYNC Start=3255644>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3256746>- You're done, Mike.<br>
- Yeah, I know.
<SYNC Start=3260081>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3261316>No!
<SYNC Start=3262482>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3262484>If she fouls you,<br>
you foul her back!
<SYNC Start=3264919>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3264921>- Yes!<br>
- Yeah.
<SYNC Start=3266419>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3266421>So there's this...<br>
This Buddhist guy, right?
<SYNC Start=3269823>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3269825>And, uh, you know,<br>
mountain man, way up high,
<SYNC Start=3273226>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3273228>going down<br>
this long winding road.
<SYNC Start=3275295>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3275297>And out of nowhere,<br>
this other guy
<SYNC Start=3278331>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3278333>is riding a horse<br>
right toward him.
<SYNC Start=3282002>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3282004>He's Buddhist too, I think.
<SYNC Start=3284370>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3284372>Actually, I'm not sure.
<SYNC Start=3286272>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3286274>Just let them<br>
both be Buddhist, Cap.
<SYNC Start=3288676>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3288678>Okay, fine.<br>
So the guy on the horse
<SYNC Start=3292579>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3292581>is riding toward our guy so fast
<SYNC Start=3295348>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3295350>that our guy's gotta<br>
get out of the way,
<SYNC Start=3297417>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3297419>so as not to be trampled<br>
by the horse.
<SYNC Start=3299352>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3299354>And the guy gets up,<br>
all dusty, and he goes:
<SYNC Start=3301654>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3301656>"Hey, where the fuck<br>
are you going?"
<SYNC Start=3304659>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3305995>And our guy on the horse,<br>
he says:
<SYNC Start=3309029>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3309031>"I don't know!
<SYNC Start=3311664>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3311666>Ask the horse!"
<SYNC Start=3314202>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3315705>Ask the horse? Huh.
<SYNC Start=3318538>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3318540>Exactly.
<SYNC Start=3319339>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3319341>Yes! Yes!
<SYNC Start=3320808>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3322110>See that face...? That. That?
<SYNC Start=3324611>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3324613>That's it.
<SYNC Start=3326013>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3326015>That was my face.
<SYNC Start=3327883>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3329852>The horse represents
<SYNC Start=3332352>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3332354>all of our fears and traumas.
<SYNC Start=3336122>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3336124>And it's got us running around<br>
a hundred miles an hour,
<SYNC Start=3340060>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3340062>to the point where we can't<br>
even answer a simple question.
<SYNC Start=3345298>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3345300>"Where are you going?"
<SYNC Start=3347402>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3349939>Where are you going, Mike?
<SYNC Start=3352072>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3355878>No, Callie!
<SYNC Start=3357276>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3357278>Don't pass!
<SYNC Start=3358444>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3358446>Shooters shoot!
<SYNC Start=3360382>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3368657>Kid's got the family curse.
<SYNC Start=3371125>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3371127>Mike...
<SYNC Start=3373326>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3373328>you gotta get control<br>
of your life.
<SYNC Start=3375963>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3375965>You gotta grab the reins
<SYNC Start=3377798>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3377800>before your horse<br>
runs you off a cliff.
<SYNC Start=3381737>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3392347>Come over for dinner.<br>
Callie would love to see you.
<SYNC Start=3395015>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3395017>I'll read you a Buddhist story.<br>
I got a book full of them.
<SYNC Start=3398118>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3398120>Wait, you gonna be<br>
cooking again?
<SYNC Start=3399953>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3399955>- Hell, yeah.<br>
- Ooh...
<SYNC Start=3401521>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3401523>- All right. We'll order pizza.<br>
- Yeah, I think I can do that.
<SYNC Start=3404424>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3411499>Bingo.
<SYNC Start=3412902>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3414602>- Cap!<br>
- I don't know! Go, go, go!
<SYNC Start=3417639>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3419742>Get him.
<SYNC Start=3420710>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3424612>I can help. What does he need?
<SYNC Start=3427282>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3428951>- Shoot.<br>
- <i>Cállate.</i>
<SYNC Start=3430920>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3433321>- Through the bitch.<br>
- No, move.
<SYNC Start=3434822>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3434824>- Get behind the car.<br>
- I can help.
<SYNC Start=3436422>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3436424>Move! Get behind the car!
<SYNC Start=3438560>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3441197>What's wrong with you, man?
<SYNC Start=3443329>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3443331>You had that shot.
<SYNC Start=3445199>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3445201>No innocents.
<SYNC Start=3446634>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3447970>You crazy, man, you know that?
<SYNC Start=3449872>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3451539>Three-fifteen. Shots fired.<br>
Officer down.
<SYNC Start=3454174>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3454176>Jose Marti Park.
<SYNC Start=3455978>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3457079>We need Air One on a three.
<SYNC Start=3459146>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3459148>This is Detective Mike Lowrey.
<SYNC Start=3461115>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3461117>The captain is down.
<SYNC Start=3463251>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3465121>The captain is down.
<SYNC Start=3466756>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3489277>Ready!
<SYNC Start=3490309>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3491346>Aim! Fire!
<SYNC Start=3493279>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3494349>Ready! Aim! Fire!
<SYNC Start=3497318>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3498220>Ready! Aim! Fire!
<SYNC Start=3502288>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3529317>You were right, man.
<SYNC Start=3530853>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3532353>You said if I went out there,<br>
I was gonna get somebody killed.
<SYNC Start=3535925>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3582204>One last time?
<SYNC Start=3583839>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3587243>One last time.
<SYNC Start=3588911>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3619460>Mama, they're all gone. It's time?
<SYNC Start=3622147>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3622388>Yes, kill him.
<SYNC Start=3623775>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3623982>But before you do it, look in his eyes<br>
and tell him something for me.
<SYNC Start=3628523>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3628815>What, mama?
<SYNC Start=3629806>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3633521>I ran a suspicious<br>
financial report on Booker.
<SYNC Start=3635956>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3635958>All his LLC fronts<br>
have the same accountant.
<SYNC Start=3639126>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3639128>Picante Jenkins, CPA.
<SYNC Start=3641795>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3641797>Yep. You don't meet<br>
too many Picantes.
<SYNC Start=3644599>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3652775>So we just gonna do<br>
a knock-and-talk?
<SYNC Start=3655108>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3655110>Yeah.
<SYNC Start=3656877>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3656879>Whoa! What the hell<br>
is all that?
<SYNC Start=3660314>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3660316>What you talking about?
<SYNC Start=3661982>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3661984>Mike, you don't need<br>
a grenade launcher.
<SYNC Start=3665152>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3665154>Yeah, but I want one.
<SYNC Start=3666820>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3666822>He's an accountant, Mike.
<SYNC Start=3668922>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3668924>Look, Mike, we're not<br>
going in there like that.
<SYNC Start=3671457>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3671459>- Like what?<br>
- Hey, look, all our lives,
<SYNC Start=3673694>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3673696>we've been bad boys, all right?
<SYNC Start=3675494>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3675496>Now it's time to be good men.
<SYNC Start=3677665>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3679034>Who in the hell<br>
wanna sing that song?
<SYNC Start=3682601>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3682603>♪ Good men,<br>

<SYNC Start=3686809>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3687843>Well, maybe if you sang the song
<SYNC Start=3689843>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3689845>like you meant it,<br>
it'd catch on.
<SYNC Start=3693113>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3693115>Nah.
<SYNC Start=3694480>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3694482>Knock and talk.
<SYNC Start=3696283>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3696285>Yeah. Knock, knock.
<SYNC Start=3697853>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3700055>- Mike! Mike!<br>

<SYNC Start=3702322>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3702324>- Mike! Mike!<br>

<SYNC Start=3703423>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3703425>- What is happening?<br>

<SYNC Start=3704590>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3704592>What happened to knock and talk?
<SYNC Start=3706093>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3706095>Hey, you broke my door.<br>
You broke my door!
<SYNC Start=3708362>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3708364>Sir, sorry about<br>
the door, okay?
<SYNC Start=3710030>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3710032>A little Gorilla Glue<br>
will make that just fine.
<SYNC Start=3712766>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3712768>- Hey, where's your warrant?<br>
- I need you on your knees
<SYNC Start=3715668>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3715670>with your hands behind<br>
your head right now!
<SYNC Start=3717771>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3720476>Sir, if you keep moving, I'm<br>
gonna shoot you in your face.
<SYNC Start=3723677>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3723679>- No, he's not.<br>
- Yes, I am!
<SYNC Start=3725412>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3725414>Mike, the man is an accountant.<br>
We just need to talk to him.
<SYNC Start=3729182>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3729184>So you wanna have<br>
a conversation
<SYNC Start=3731084>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3731086>with a coked-out<br>
orange mountain?
<SYNC Start=3733420>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3733422>Here's the latest figures.
<SYNC Start=3735255>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3735257>Look, let me handle this, okay?<br>
Just back up.
<SYNC Start=3738058>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3738060>I'm gonna penetrate<br>
this man's soul with my heart.
<SYNC Start=3742129>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3742131>What?
<SYNC Start=3743163>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3743165>Yeah.
<SYNC Start=3744297>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3744299>Watch and learn.
<SYNC Start=3746601>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3747836>Hey! Hey, ass licker.
<SYNC Start=3749036>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3749038>I'm gonna fast-food<br>
fist-fuck you.
<SYNC Start=3751371>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3751373>Sir, that's just nasty.
<SYNC Start=3753740>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3753742>Now, I recognize that this<br>
is a difficult situation.
<SYNC Start=3757177>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3757179>- Don't come over here.<br>
- Don't go over there, Marcus.
<SYNC Start=3759880>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3759882>We just need<br>
your client's receipts.
<SYNC Start=3762315>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3762317>- What?<br>
- Booker Grassie.
<SYNC Start=3764718>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3764720>- Any record of...?<br>
- Unh!
<SYNC Start=3765988>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3768223>Mm.
<SYNC Start=3769158>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3770292>Hey. How deep you think<br>
you got in his soul?
<SYNC Start=3774428>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3774430>Sometime you gotta suffer<br>
for what is right.
<SYNC Start=3777531>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3777533>Don't you turn<br>
that other cheek.
<SYNC Start=3779266>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3779268>- Get off me!<br>
- All right.
<SYNC Start=3781001>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3783005>Now, sir, I realize<br>
that you're scared.
<SYNC Start=3786273>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3786275>Hell, we all scared.<br>
You know, sometimes fear just...
<SYNC Start=3790712>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3799354>So, what you thinking?
<SYNC Start=3801455>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3803959>I think you should<br>
handle this one.
<SYNC Start=3806493>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3806495>Yeah, me too.
<SYNC Start=3807660>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3808897>Hey!
<SYNC Start=3810363>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3810365>MLK just tapped out.<br>
You got Brother Malcolm now.
<SYNC Start=3812999>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3813001>We can handle this<br>
by any means necessary.
<SYNC Start=3815068>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3815070>I recognize you.<br>
You're that cop that got shot.
<SYNC Start=3817337>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3817339>Bad year you're having,<br>
Butterscotch.
<SYNC Start=3819638>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3819640>If you didn't have that gun<br>
and badge, I'd fucking eat you.
<SYNC Start=3823543>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3823545>This the only thing that's<br>
keeping you from eating me?
<SYNC Start=3826513>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3826515>- Yeah.<br>
- Oh.
<SYNC Start=3828684>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3830152>Bring it, big boy.
<SYNC Start=3831384>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3837493>- Left line clear!<br>

are y'all doing here?
<SYNC Start=3843230>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3843232>I called them.
<SYNC Start=3845265>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3845267>What? What happened to bad boys<br>
one last time?
<SYNC Start=3849536>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3849538>This is one last time.
<SYNC Start=3851371>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3851373>But this here's the remix, Mike.
<SYNC Start=3853740>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3853742>We work with AMMO now.
<SYNC Start=3855277>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3859515>That's that shit, okay?
<SYNC Start=3861114>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3861116>You got three seconds<br>
before I bite it off.
<SYNC Start=3864885>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3864887>Get your damn finger<br>
out my face.
<SYNC Start=3867420>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3867422>So tell us.<br>
Judge, prosecutor, criminal informant,
<SYNC Start=3871057>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3871059>the captain, and you.<br>
Who do you have in common?
<SYNC Start=3873760>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3873762>Hundreds of investigations,<br>
operations...
<SYNC Start=3875962>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3875964>Eight hundred<br>
and forty-seven cases
<SYNC Start=3877731>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3877733>in the nexus of the victims.
<SYNC Start=3879099>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3879101>Well, who up there<br>
wants to kill you?
<SYNC Start=3881268>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3881270>- Hell, who doesn't?<br>
- All right.
<SYNC Start=3883069>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3883071>That just the criminals<br>
that we're looking at.
<SYNC Start=3885338>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3885340>I don't trust a person<br>
that don't wanna kill him.
<SYNC Start=3887741>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3887743>- Hell, put my name up there.<br>
- Thanks. Got it. Appreciate it.
<SYNC Start=3891044>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3891046>What you get<br>
out of the accountant?
<SYNC Start=3892646>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3892648>- His records are a mess.<br>
- Surprising.
<SYNC Start=3894814>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3894816>But I did manage<br>
to get into his Keychain.
<SYNC Start=3897684>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3897686>- So?<br>
- All of his social.
<SYNC Start=3899853>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3901056>Boom.
<SYNC Start=3902024>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3903525>Looking at a lot of dick pics
<SYNC Start=3904891>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3904893>but not so many clues.
<SYNC Start=3906159>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3906161>Facial rec for anyone<br>
in our system.
<SYNC Start=3908128>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3908130>On it.
<SYNC Start=3909398>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3910799>That's three days<br>
before I got hit.
<SYNC Start=3913166>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3913168>Hey, go back to that last shot.<br>
The chain.
<SYNC Start=3915869>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3915871>Yeah, zoom in.
<SYNC Start=3918972>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3918974>- Heh. Zway-Lo.<br>
- Zway-Lo.
<SYNC Start=3921041>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3921043>- Who's Zway-Lo?<br>
- Lorenzo Rodriguez.
<SYNC Start=3924244>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3924246>Goes by Zway-Lo.
<SYNC Start=3925712>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3925714>Used to coach him<br>
in peewee hoops
<SYNC Start=3927714>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3927716>before he went<br>
for that thug shit.
<SYNC Start=3929382>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3929384>Great player, but I had to bench<br>
him during the championship.
<SYNC Start=3932152>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3932154>You benched a 10-year-old<br>
in the championship?
<SYNC Start=3934521>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3934523>Yeah. Little fucker<br>
called me a dickhead.
<SYNC Start=3936957>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3936959>- Did y'all win at least?<br>
- Hell, no.
<SYNC Start=3938992>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3938994>He was our star player.
<SYNC Start=3940360>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3940362>We lost by 40,<br>
but I made my point.
<SYNC Start=3943563>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3943565>Okay, there's no "I" in "team."
<SYNC Start=3945632>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3945634>There is one in "dickhead"<br>
though.
<SYNC Start=3947167>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3947169>Man, shut up. Look, Zway-Lo's<br>
into drugs, weapons.
<SYNC Start=3951171>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3951173>He's one<br>
of Taglin's lieutenants.
<SYNC Start=3953039>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3953041>Taglin was found dead<br>
the same night Mike got shot.
<SYNC Start=3955676>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3955678>I guess he's someone<br>
else's lieutenant now.
<SYNC Start=3958245>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3958247>Lorenzo Rodriguez.
<SYNC Start=3959813>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3959815>No mortgage,<br>
not even a bank account.
<SYNC Start=3963016>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3963018>But it is his birthday tomorrow.
<SYNC Start=3965218>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3965220>If he's celebrating, there's<br>
three spots for a cat like that.
<SYNC Start=3968689>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3968691>Ditto, Ice 45, Zillion.
<SYNC Start=3971825>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3971827>Can you get into<br>
their club records?
<SYNC Start=3973493>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3973495>Pfft, Ice 45 should really up<br>
their cyber security.
<SYNC Start=3977998>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3978000>Okay. Ice 45.
<SYNC Start=3980667>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=3980669>Ditto. Zillion.
<SYNC Start=3983171>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=4419272>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4419274>Mike, pull over for a minute.<br>
I need to tell you something.
<SYNC Start=4423242>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4423244>- Pull over?<br>
- Yeah.
<SYNC Start=4424610>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4424612>One second. Let me see<br>
if Zway will pull over.
<SYNC Start=4426980>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4426982>Zway-Lo! Marcus needs<br>
to pull over for a second!
<SYNC Start=4430616>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4430618>Hey, can we get a time-out?
<SYNC Start=4432052>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4432054>Damn it, Mike, I need<br>
to tell you something!
<SYNC Start=4434520>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4434522>- What?<br>
- I made a promise to God.
<SYNC Start=4436589>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4436591>- To who?<br>
- To God.
<SYNC Start=4438826>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4438828>What the hell<br>
are you talking about?
<SYNC Start=4440728>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4440730>Look, I told the Lord<br>
that if you made it through
<SYNC Start=4444464>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4444466>that I would make<br>
no more violence.
<SYNC Start=4446599>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4446601>He definitely knew<br>
you was bullshitting with that.
<SYNC Start=4449002>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4449004>Violence is what we do.
<SYNC Start=4450436>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4454009>It's about your soul, Mike.
<SYNC Start=4455641>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4455643>Our job is to protect and serve.
<SYNC Start=4458212>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4458214>You're damn right. I'm about<br>
to serve this bitch right now.
<SYNC Start=4461882>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4476331>- Oh, shit! What...?<br>
- Oh, shit.
<SYNC Start=4478431>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4478433>Oh, look at that!
<SYNC Start=4480234>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4480236>- Damn!<br>

- Oh!
<SYNC Start=4485939>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4485941>- Yeah, I see it.<br>
- Hey, stop it.
<SYNC Start=4488407>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4488409>- It's calling me, Mike.<br>
- What? Leave it...
<SYNC Start=4490543>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4490545>I can't help it,<br>
but it's calling me.
<SYNC Start=4492545>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4492547>Stop it. What the hell<br>
is wrong with you?
<SYNC Start=4494547>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4494549>Just leave it alone.
<SYNC Start=4496083>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4496085>Yo, leave it alone.
<SYNC Start=4497084>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4497086>- Leave... Marcus.<br>
- Ahh!
<SYNC Start=4498551>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4498553>- You're gonna pop that shit!<br>
- That shit nasty!
<SYNC Start=4500687>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4500689>- Then leave it alone.<br>
- Oh, shit. Oh!
<SYNC Start=4503623>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4503625>- Damn.<br>
- Oh...
<SYNC Start=4505793>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4505795>Just leave it alone! Let's...

One more again.
<SYNC Start=4509062>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4510266>Overtown is waking up.<br>
Let's go.
<SYNC Start=4511965>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4511967>- <i>AMMO, where you at?</i><br>
- Got jammed up.
<SYNC Start=4514234>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4514236>- Hitting Overtown now.<br>
- Gear up.
<SYNC Start=4515869>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=4540294>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4540296>Oh, shit!
<SYNC Start=4542595>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=4544198>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4544200>Wake up! Wake up!<br>
Wake your ass up!
<SYNC Start=4547835>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4547837>Coach Burnett?
<SYNC Start=4549337>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4550873>Dickhead.
<SYNC Start=4552505>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4552507>- Ahh!<br>
- Still think I'm a dickhead?
<SYNC Start=4555845>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4556812>Zway-Lo, who wants to kill me?
<SYNC Start=4558411>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4558413>Shit, everybody wanna kill you.
<SYNC Start=4560446>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4560448>Yeah, I told you, Mike.
<SYNC Start=4561947>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4561949>Forget about me! Kill them both!
<SYNC Start=4564218>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4564220>- What's he saying?<br>
- Kill them both!
<SYNC Start=4566019>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4566021>What's he saying?
<SYNC Start=4568021>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4569424>- Y'all both dying tonight.<br>

<SYNC Start=4576397>Thank you, God!
<SYNC Start=4577931>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4582503>Why'd you let him get away?!
<SYNC Start=4584672>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4586141>Lay suppression fire!
<SYNC Start=4587609>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4604360>- Oh, shit!<br>

<SYNC Start=4606525>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4606527>- There's a pit bull!<br>

<SYNC Start=4626749>- Oh, shit.<br>

<SYNC Start=4628614>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4628616>It's like an angry white man's<br>
basement in here.
<SYNC Start=4631885>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4634455>- Shit, a fucking grenade.<br>
- Pull it.
<SYNC Start=4636957>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4636959>- Pull it!<br>
- This ain't fucking Vietnam!
<SYNC Start=4640459>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=4667156>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4668357>Ahh! Oh, yeah!

- No, no, Mike!
<SYNC Start=4674194>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4674196>I made a promise<br>
to God! No more violence.
<SYNC Start=4677064>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4681971>Who do you think<br>
sent you that weapon?
<SYNC Start=4684037>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4684039>- I don't know!<br>
- That is God's gun!
<SYNC Start=4686539>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4686541>- It is?!<br>
- Sent in your time of need.
<SYNC Start=4688742>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4688744>Well, shit!<br>
I do need it now!
<SYNC Start=4690077>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4690079>Yes. You are a vessel<br>
for the Lord's work.
<SYNC Start=4692645>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4692647>- Yeah, I'm a vessel.<br>
- Like David and Goliath.
<SYNC Start=4694547>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4694549>- Yeah, David with the slingshot.<br>
- Yes! That is your slingshot!
<SYNC Start=4698885>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4698887>- Yeah!<br>
- To smite thine enemies!
<SYNC Start=4701654>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4701656>You know what?<br>
Bad boys of the Bible, baby!
<SYNC Start=4704657>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4704659>- Exactly! Amen? Amen?<br>
- Amen! Amen!
<SYNC Start=4708395>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4710565>- Shit!<br>
- Where are your glasses?
<SYNC Start=4713033>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4713035>- I don't need no damn glasses!<br>
- You ain't hitting shit!
<SYNC Start=4716370>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4724246>Oh! Oh, oh!

<SYNC Start=4946068>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=4949603>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4949605>I been there before. Many times.
<SYNC Start=4952405>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4952407>It's gonna be all right.
<SYNC Start=4953807>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4953809>That's Zway-Lo's phone.<br>
Can you break it?
<SYNC Start=4956378>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4959281>- Yeah. What am I looking for?<br>
- Who he's talking to. Call logs.
<SYNC Start=4963452>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4965087>And I'm gonna need you<br>
to hurry up just a little bit.
<SYNC Start=4968323>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4969858>Okay, but I'm gonna<br>
have to go on the dark side.
<SYNC Start=4972993>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4972995>All right. You good with that?
<SYNC Start=4975264>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4976498>Yeah.
<SYNC Start=4977497>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4977499>- Yeah.<br>
- Yeah. Let's do it.
<SYNC Start=4978865>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4981870>Dorn, he's a big guy.
<SYNC Start=4984304>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4984306>How'd he get so good<br>
at this stuff?
<SYNC Start=4986072>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4986074>- What stuff?<br>
- Tech shit.
<SYNC Start=4988275>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4988277>- He looks like a killer.<br>
- Is. Used to be a bouncer.
<SYNC Start=4992012>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4992014>Guy one night was getting<br>
physical with a woman...
<SYNC Start=4994381>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4994383>Yeah, big man lost it.<br>
Hit him.
<SYNC Start=4996616>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=4996618>- Bastard dropped dead.<br>
- Avoided the fight ever since.
<SYNC Start=5000355>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5002457>Here we go.
<SYNC Start=5003859>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5005827>Give me the last two months.
<SYNC Start=5008495>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5008497>Shit.
<SYNC Start=5009663>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5009665>Mexico.
<SYNC Start=5011166>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5012167>What are you after here?
<SYNC Start=5014634>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5014636>All right. To each one<br>
of those numbers,
<SYNC Start=5016636>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5016638>I need you to text the phrase,<br>
<i>"Hasta el fuego."</i>
<SYNC Start=5021009>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=5025180>All right. I got it. Thank you.
<SYNC Start=5028148>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5028150>- You sure?<br>
- I got it. Go.
<SYNC Start=5030116>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5094416>We're shut down.
<SYNC Start=5095415>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5095417>- What?<br>
- What do you mean, shut down?
<SYNC Start=5097417>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5097419>AMMO's done.
<SYNC Start=5098553>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5100622>I'm sorry.
<SYNC Start=5102021>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5102023>Look, everything's<br>
gonna be all right.
<SYNC Start=5103758>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=5105826>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5105828>Everything's gonna be all right.
<SYNC Start=5107596>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5120575>Mm-mm.
<SYNC Start=5121709>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5121711>Mike.
<SYNC Start=5123011>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5129050>You all right?
<SYNC Start=5130318>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5132921>I think he's my son.
<SYNC Start=5134822>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5134824>What?
<SYNC Start=5136091>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5146601>Twenty-four years ago,<br>
before we partnered up, um...
<SYNC Start=5152272>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5152274>Captain Howard pulled me<br>
right out of the academy.
<SYNC Start=5155108>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5155110>Uh, nobody knew who I was.
<SYNC Start=5157377>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5157379>He sent me in undercover<br>
with the Aretas cartel.
<SYNC Start=5161249>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5162685><i>Sorenson.</i>
<SYNC Start=5163918>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5163920><i>Weber.</i>
<SYNC Start=5165185>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5165187><i>Vargas. Carver.</i>
<SYNC Start=5166986>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5166988>All of the victims<br>
were on that case.
<SYNC Start=5169956>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5169958>This is revenge.
<SYNC Start=5171291>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5171293>Yeah, Mike, but you<br>
weren't on that case.
<SYNC Start=5173593>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5173595>My name wasn't on it.
<SYNC Start=5176062>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5176064>That's how deep I was.
<SYNC Start=5177700>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5178901>I was Ricky Rollins.
<SYNC Start=5180935>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5180937>Benito Aretas.
<SYNC Start=5182903>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5182905>He's dead, Mike.<br>
He ain't after you.
<SYNC Start=5185538>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5185540>Not him.
<SYNC Start=5187106>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5187108>His wife.
<SYNC Start=5188443>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5189946>Isabel.
<SYNC Start=5191179>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5192180>I was her driver.
<SYNC Start=5194013>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5194015>We connected so... deep.
<SYNC Start=5197751>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5197753>We talked about everything.<br>
She showed me the whole game.
<SYNC Start=5202155>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5202157>How to walk it, how to talk it,<br>
put clothes on it.
<SYNC Start=5206259>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5206261>She made Mike Lowrey.
<SYNC Start=5209498>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5211868>- We fell in love.<br>
- Heh.
<SYNC Start=5213701>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5213703>Are you telling me<br>
the one time that you...?
<SYNC Start=5215903>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5215905>Isabel Aretas.
<SYNC Start=5217938>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5217940>The one time.
<SYNC Start=5219773>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5219775>Takedown was coming.<br>
DEA, ATF, everybody.
<SYNC Start=5224177>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5224179>And I was gonna ghost<br>
the whole operation.
<SYNC Start=5227781>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5227783>Me and Isabel were gonna<br>
run away with each other.
<SYNC Start=5230483>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5230485>What made you change your mind?
<SYNC Start=5232953>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5232955>They call her <i>La Bruja.</i>
<SYNC Start=5235457>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5236491>The Witch.
<SYNC Start=5237624>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5238728><i>She is into some dark shit.</i>
<SYNC Start=5242262>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5242264><i>Santa Muerte.</i>
<SYNC Start=5243665>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5244834>That woman...
<SYNC Start=5247066>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5247068>was a stone-cold killer.
<SYNC Start=5251072>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5252207><i>So I had to put<br>
the woman I love</i>
<SYNC Start=5253741>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5253743><i>behind bars<br>
for the rest of her life.</i>
<SYNC Start=5257078>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5260382>Chose the badge, and I've been<br>
choosing it ever since.
<SYNC Start=5263686>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5265587>Mike, you fucked<br>
a married witch?
<SYNC Start=5269224>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5270760>So all the shit I just said,<br>
and that was your takeaway?
<SYNC Start=5274561>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5274563>No, it's just a lot to digest.
<SYNC Start=5276496>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5276498>You think<br>
you know somebody and...
<SYNC Start=5278832>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5278834>Well, hell, now it explains why<br>
you dress like a drug dealer.
<SYNC Start=5283369>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5283371>So you wanna hear<br>
this shit or you don't?
<SYNC Start=5285405>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5285407>Sorry. But you don't know<br>
that's your son, Mike.
<SYNC Start=5288341>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5288343>You don't know<br>
who that witch was fucking.
<SYNC Start=5290579>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5292715>Benito Aretas<br>
couldn't have kids.
<SYNC Start=5295381>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5295383>Isabel gave birth in prison,<br>
eight months after her arrest.
<SYNC Start=5299218>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5299220><i>"Hasta el fuego."</i><br>
He said that to me
<SYNC Start=5301321>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5301323>before I jumped<br>
from the chopper.

<SYNC Start=5303158><i>Me and Isabel made that up.</i>
<SYNC Start=5306125>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5306127><i>It's not even real Spanish.</i>
<SYNC Start=5307695>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5307697><i>It's some shit<br>
we said to each other.</i>
<SYNC Start=5309562>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5309564><i>It meant like, "We'll be<br>
together until we burn."</i>
<SYNC Start=5312654>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5312656>The traitor is coming.
<SYNC Start=5313941>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5315078>Get prepared.
<SYNC Start=5315983>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5317162>We will.
<SYNC Start=5317965>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5318361>Let's go!
<SYNC Start=5320207>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5320475>- Nah, Mike.<br>
- Marcus, he's the right age.
<SYNC Start=5323643>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5323645><i>He's crazy like me.<br>
He's ruthless like me.</i>
<SYNC Start=5326112>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5326114><i>He's fearless like me.</i>
<SYNC Start=5327848>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5327850>He's the fucked-up me.
<SYNC Start=5329984>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5329986>No, Mike.
<SYNC Start=5331752>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5331754>You the fucked-up you.
<SYNC Start=5333321>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5334489>You jumping to conclusions.<br>
All right?
<SYNC Start=5336824>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5336826>Shit's gonna work itself out.<br>
You gotta trust that.
<SYNC Start=5340159>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5340161>Yeah...
<SYNC Start=5341496>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5343231>You're right.
<SYNC Start=5344633>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5347036>Oh, man.
<SYNC Start=5348736>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5348738>Aw.
<SYNC Start=5349872>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5350906>I love you, man.
<SYNC Start=5353007>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5353009>I love you, man.
<SYNC Start=5354442>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5356211>- I gotta go. All right?<br>
- Mike.
<SYNC Start=5358346>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5359514>Mike.
<SYNC Start=5360914>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5417873>Let me get past you there, sir.<br>
Sorry there. Excuse me.
<SYNC Start=5422109>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5422111>Excuse me.
<SYNC Start=5424210>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5425580>That's the right spot<br>
for me right there.
<SYNC Start=5428982>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5428984>Oh, excuse me, sir.
<SYNC Start=5430818>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5430820>Seat right there.
<SYNC Start=5432418>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5432420>Let me get by you.<br>
Watch your toes.
<SYNC Start=5434420>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5434422>Watch your toes there.
<SYNC Start=5436156>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5436158>It's all right. There you go.
<SYNC Start=5438624>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5440730>No, Marcus.
<SYNC Start=5441627>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5441629>I'm not letting you go
<SYNC Start=5442763>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5442765>on a suicide mission<br>
alone, Mike.
<SYNC Start=5445467>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5446401>This is on me.
<SYNC Start=5448001>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5448003>I'm not letting anybody else<br>
get killed dealing with my shit.
<SYNC Start=5451337>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5451339>Mike, she's a <i>bruja.</i>
<SYNC Start=5453639>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5453641>She'll make your eyes melt<br>
into your stupid-ass head.
<SYNC Start=5456677>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5456679>She'll make your dick fall off.
<SYNC Start=5458814>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5460381>I meant penis.
<SYNC Start=5461849>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5461851>You should be minding<br>
your own business anyway.
<SYNC Start=5465418>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5465420>Marcus, please go home.
<SYNC Start=5468222>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5468224>We fly together.<br>
We die together.
<SYNC Start=5471424>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5471426>- What?<br>
- Oh, no.
<SYNC Start=5473193>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5473195>That's just something we say.
<SYNC Start=5475028>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5475030>It's all good. It ain't...
<SYNC Start=5477463>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5477465>Oh, I can see how that<br>
got y'all a little...
<SYNC Start=5480033>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5480035>Uh, where y'all from?<br>
Where you from?
<SYNC Start=5483605>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5488409>So, what you gonna do<br>
when you see him?
<SYNC Start=5490811>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5490813>You really gonna<br>
put your son behind bars?
<SYNC Start=5493312>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5493314>No. I'm gonna kill him.
<SYNC Start=5496282>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5497285>Kill him?
<SYNC Start=5498584>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5498586>You really gonna kill<br>
your own son, Mike?
<SYNC Start=5501587>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5501589>I'm gonna put him<br>
in a fucking bag.
<SYNC Start=5505625>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5505627>- You mind if we switch seats?<br>
- Yeah, please.
<SYNC Start=5508427>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5508429>Excuse me.
<SYNC Start=5509832>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5513869>You realize<br>
you will go to hell?
<SYNC Start=5516870>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5516872>- I don't believe in hell, Marcus.<br>
- Well, it believes in you.
<SYNC Start=5520540>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5520542>I mean, killing your own son.
<SYNC Start=5522276>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5522278>Brother, that's a darkness<br>
that swallows you whole.
<SYNC Start=5526546>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5526548>Well, maybe I already<br>
been swallowed.
<SYNC Start=5530618>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5531553>I died, remember?
<SYNC Start=5534353>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5534355>I'm ending this shit, man.
<SYNC Start=5536624>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5539995>I should have known<br>
he was your son.
<SYNC Start=5542595>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5542597>Because the way<br>
he whupped your ass, Mike.
<SYNC Start=5546834>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5546836>That was a ass-whupping<br>
straight from thy own loins.
<SYNC Start=5550570>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5550572>A supernatural ass-whupping.
<SYNC Start=5553006>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5553008>- Mm-mm.<br>
- Well...
<SYNC Start=5554708>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5554710>Mm-mm.
<SYNC Start=5555541>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5560282>Can I be the godfather?
<SYNC Start=5562648>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5562650>You know<br>
what you can be, Marcus?
<SYNC Start=5564450>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5564452>- What?<br>
- Quiet.
<SYNC Start=5566452>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5566454>- Oh, I should be quiet?<br>
- Yeah.
<SYNC Start=5568088>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5568090>All right, you just had<br>
a warlock baby with <i>La Bruja</i>
<SYNC Start=5571591>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5571593>who's trying to kill<br>
your ass, probably mine too,
<SYNC Start=5574695>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5574697>sucking our blood<br>
and all of that shit,
<SYNC Start=5577097>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5577099>but I should be quiet.
<SYNC Start=5579398>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5579400>Yeah. Yeah, okay, Mike.
<SYNC Start=5582269>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5585174>How you fuck a witch<br>
without a condom?
<SYNC Start=5588574>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5588576>You wrap that shit up, man.
<SYNC Start=5590978>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5590980>Hey, my man.<br>
We need to change seats.
<SYNC Start=5593046>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5593048>Yep. Okay.
<SYNC Start=5594781>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5660115>Mike <i>y</i> Marcus.
<SYNC Start=5662550>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5667690>This makes us even<br>
for Miami.
<SYNC Start=5669925>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5683205>Yo, we hot.
<SYNC Start=5684637>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5699654>- You called them again.<br>
- Hey, Rita called me.
<SYNC Start=5702758>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5704525>- What's up, fellas?<br>
- Hey.
<SYNC Start=5706259>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5706261>Hey. Hey.
<SYNC Start=5708627>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5708629><i>Hola.</i>
<SYNC Start=5709798>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5710866>I feel better when they're here.
<SYNC Start=5713166>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5713168>Yeah, me too.
<SYNC Start=5714703>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5716504>Whoa, where'd you get<br>
all the toys?
<SYNC Start=5718537>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5718539>DEA station in Cuernavaca.
<SYNC Start=5720173>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5720175>We capture her,<br>
they take the credit.
<SYNC Start=5723076>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5723078>Get ourselves killed, they've<br>
got nothing to do with it.
<SYNC Start=5726380>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5726382>All eyes on me.
<SYNC Start=5728115>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5728117>I'm the bait.<br>
We meet at Hidalgo Palace.
<SYNC Start=5730851>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5730853>It's an old hotel<br>
outside the city.
<SYNC Start=5732853>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5732855>I'll keep her talking<br>
till you guys spot the shooter.
<SYNC Start=5735722>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5735724>- What if she just shoots you?<br>
- Nah, she's gonna wanna talk.
<SYNC Start=5739359>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5739361>We, uh... have history.
<SYNC Start=5742095>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5742097>Okay. Snatch and grab.<br>
We get them,
<SYNC Start=5743897>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5743899>and we're on a plane<br>
to the States by dawn.
<SYNC Start=5746235>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5747903>Dorn, get me a floor-plan<br>
satellite image.
<SYNC Start=5750337>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5750339>We'll have eyes<br>
on the outside and...
<SYNC Start=5755110>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5756445>on the inside.
<SYNC Start=5757944>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5757946>Hey. Nobody touches the shooter.<br>
He's mine.
<SYNC Start=5761715>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5761717>Uh, yes, he is.
<SYNC Start=5763683>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5777199>You, uh, coloring a little bit<br>
outside the lines today, huh?
<SYNC Start=5780903>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5784440>Don't die.
<SYNC Start=5785640>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5786508>You make sure we both come home.
<SYNC Start=5788777>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5816338>No identifiable threats.<br>
Monitoring channels inside.
<SYNC Start=5819473>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5819475>Jamming everything in case
<SYNC Start=5820740>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5820742>they're running<br>
countersurveillance.
<SYNC Start=5822676>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5822678>No way she's here alone.
<SYNC Start=5824111>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5824113>It's the cartel. She's gonna<br>
have serious backup.
<SYNC Start=5826947>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5826949>Marcus is moving<br>
towards the back.
<SYNC Start=5828515>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5828517>Marcus, we're covering<br>
your position from the sky.
<SYNC Start=5831284>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5831286>Still nothing.
<SYNC Start=5833220>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5833222>Moving in closer.
<SYNC Start=5835122>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5878333><i>Hola,</i> Ricky.
<SYNC Start=5879735>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5880676>Or should I call you Mike?
<SYNC Start=5882469>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5882471><i>Hola,</i> Isabel.
<SYNC Start=5884072>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5901309>Not very thorough.
<SYNC Start=5902742>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5906225>There was a time when touching<br>
me would have melted you.
<SYNC Start=5908538>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5909598>I'm gonna kill her myself.
<SYNC Start=5911366>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5913435>Keep it.
<SYNC Start=5914403>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5917706>Where is he?
<SYNC Start=5920340>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5920344>This used to be our place.
<SYNC Start=5921979>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5923040>I wanted you dead...
<SYNC Start=5924756>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5925214>but you survived.
<SYNC Start=5926864>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5928024>Perhaps I made you too strong.
<SYNC Start=5930647>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5931809>Or perhaps...
<SYNC Start=5933023>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5934511>Santa Muerte is telling us something.
<SYNC Start=5936877>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5939947>We were fated to meet one more time.
<SYNC Start=5942697>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5942864>This is some<br>
real telenovela shit.
<SYNC Start=5945332>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5954810>Ah...
<SYNC Start=5956111>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5956189>I've taken care of that.
<SYNC Start=5957962>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5959716>Shit!
<SYNC Start=5960882>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5961817>I just lost all comms.
<SYNC Start=5963350>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5963352>- Fuck. AMMO?<br>
- Marcus, come in.
<SYNC Start=5965952>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5965954>- Shit.<br>
- They're jamming us.
<SYNC Start=5968355>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5968357>They know we're here.<br>
This is fucked.
<SYNC Start=5970357>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5970359>- I can't get back in.<br>
- Still got Baby Barry
<SYNC Start=5972592>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5972594>on an outside frequency.
<SYNC Start=5974363>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5974716>It's just us now.
<SYNC Start=5976260>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5977156>Why didn't you tell me I had a son?
<SYNC Start=5979547>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5985463>What would you have done?
<SYNC Start=5986912>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5988314>Taken care of him.
<SYNC Start=5989090>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5989111>Mm.
<SYNC Start=5990212>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5990312>Like you took care of me?
<SYNC Start=5991536>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5996952>It was gonna be a surprise.
<SYNC Start=5999953>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=5999955>After we ran away.
<SYNC Start=6001556>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6010899>I'm seeing tactical movement.
<SYNC Start=6012499>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6012501>Twenty to 30 threats<br>
forming a perimeter.
<SYNC Start=6014702>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6014704>We gotta go.
<SYNC Start=6015835>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6015837>- Alt points of entry?<br>
- Here.
<SYNC Start=6018104>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6018106>That cold airflow could be<br>
a laundry exhaust.
<SYNC Start=6020307>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6020309>How could you do this<br>
to our son?
<SYNC Start=6022575>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6022577>My son.
<SYNC Start=6023910>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6023912>Who does he think I am?
<SYNC Start=6025412>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6025414>Exactly who you are:
<SYNC Start=6027280>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6027282>The coward, the traitor...
<SYNC Start=6029949>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6033021>Don't do this.
<SYNC Start=6035455>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6044032>Keep it moving, detective.
<SYNC Start=6045965>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6054811>You see that?
<SYNC Start=6056443>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6056445>Drop it.
<SYNC Start=6058645>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6058647>Let's go!
<SYNC Start=6060313>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6060315>Let's go!
<SYNC Start=6061581>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6061583>What you gonna do?
<SYNC Start=6063049>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6063051>- <i>Hasta el fuego.</i><br>
- Whoa.
<SYNC Start=6064785>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6064787>No <i>"el suego."</i><br>
That means fire, right?
<SYNC Start=6066920>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6066922>- <i>Cállate.</i><br>
- No, no <i>"cate."</i>
<SYNC Start=6069055>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6069057>You and this man need to talk.
<SYNC Start=6070924>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6070926>- It's life-changing shit.<br>
- Shut the fuck up.
<SYNC Start=6073026>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6073028>- Easy on the barrel! Easy!<br>
- Marcus, relax.
<SYNC Start=6075395>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6075397>Mike, it's lack of communication<br>
that got this shit fucked up.
<SYNC Start=6079632>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6079634>He needs to tell you something.<br>
You ain't gonna like it,
<SYNC Start=6082202>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6082204>but you need to hear it.
<SYNC Start=6083838>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6109699>Oh, shit!
<SYNC Start=6111066>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6114403>Yo, Mike,<br>
they're moving up to the chopper!
<SYNC Start=6117172>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6120475>Marcus!
<SYNC Start=6122108>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6128718>- Put your glasses on!<br>
- What the hell was that?
<SYNC Start=6131752>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6131754>That was a bad throw!
<SYNC Start=6133286>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6137426>Yo, Mike, careful!
<SYNC Start=6139361>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6142364>You were right<br>
about the glasses.
<SYNC Start=6144164>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6144166>I been telling your ass<br>
that shit for years.
<SYNC Start=6147135>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=6169624>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6182604>Go! Go, go, go!
<SYNC Start=6184239>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6192214>Hey, Isabel and the shooter<br>
went up the stairs.
<SYNC Start=6195114>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6195116>Can you cover us?
<SYNC Start=6196851>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6196853>- Kelly! Flank right!<br>
- Copy!

<SYNC Start=6206161>I'm gonna need you<br>
to hurt some people.
<SYNC Start=6208094>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6208096>I'll pay for therapy,<br>
all right?
<SYNC Start=6209763>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6209765>I'm gonna need it. Seriously.
<SYNC Start=6212131>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6212133>- Yeah, I got you.<br>
- I'll hold the middle.
<SYNC Start=6214735>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6214737>- You push hard for the stairs.<br>

<SYNC Start=6611200>Ask your mother.
<SYNC Start=6612398>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6621515>Is it true what he says?
<SYNC Start=6623147>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6626212>It doesn't matter. He's nothing to you.

<SYNC Start=6863919>My therapist thought<br>
it'd be beneficial
<SYNC Start=6865852>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6865854>if maybe we could hit up<br>
a group sesh together.
<SYNC Start=6868155>&nbsp;

<SYNC Start=6891246>thank you.
<SYNC Start=6892445>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6894016>Mike, you don't<br>
have to thank me.
<SYNC Start=6896616>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6896618>If you wanna retire,
<SYNC Start=6898919>&nbsp;

them blue pills, right?
<SYNC Start=6950804>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6950806>I don't need<br>
no damn blue pills.
<SYNC Start=6952372>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6952374>That's what you said<br>
about your glasses.
<SYNC Start=6954341>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=6954343>That baby looks good<br>
